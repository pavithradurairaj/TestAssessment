# TestAssessment

AFter cloning the project go to the project directory from the cmd and then type 

mvn install 

so that it will install all the required jar files(internet connection should be available) and it will run the test cases.

Notes:
1. If any of the test cases has'nt run means we have to check the TestNG.xml file and look for enable option in every test tag set to True.

2. Change the data in the excel file as it will take only the unique values in the apply education loan test. If its required we can make it unique from the code by appending the random generator to the data passed from the excel. Because of time constraints has'nt implemented it.
