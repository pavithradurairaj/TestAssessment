# TestAssessment

AFter cloning the project go to the project directory from the cmd and then type 

mvn install 

so that it will install all the required jar files(internet connection should be available) and it will run the test cases.

If any of the test cases hasnt run means we have to check the TestNG.xml file and look for enable option in every test tag set to True.
